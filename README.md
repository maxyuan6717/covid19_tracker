This application uses the API at https://api.covid19api.com/ to fetch information about the current COVID-19 pandemic.

The data is then displayed as a line graph for easy analysis.

The data can be filtered either globally or by country.

The basic design of this application is from this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls. However, I used a better API to get daily data for specific countries and rearranged the components. Also added local storage functionality to reduce the number of API requests made.
